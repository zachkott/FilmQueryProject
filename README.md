# FilmQueryProject
# Description
For this weeks project we were tasked with creating a film query application that allows the user to look up details about different movies. When the user opens the  application they will be greeted with a main menu that gives them three options. If the user selects a 1 the user will be asked to enter a film id. Once the user enter the film id the application will search through the database and return the details of the movie that corresponds to the film id. If the user enters a 2, they will be able to search for a movie using a keyword. Once the user selects this option they will be asked to enter a keyword. After entering the keyword the application will search through the database and return any movies that contain the keyword in it's title or description. Finally if the user enters a 3 the application will terminate and the user will see a goodbye message.

# Technologies Used
Java, mySQL, Maven, Database, Eclipse, Atom, Object Oriented Programming, Interfaces

# Lessons Learned
During this project I learned how to use java to access information from a mySQL database. I learned how to use select statements to access information and connect related fields. However, I definitely think I could use more practice with my select statements.
